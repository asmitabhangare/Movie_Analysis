In this project, I analyzed movie data using multiple tables containing detailed information about movies, genres, directors, roles, and ratings.

*Key Features of the Analysis:*

- **Movie Details:** Examined various attributes of movies such as title, year of release, duration, country of origin, worldwide gross income, languages spoken, and production companies.
* **Genre Analysis:** Analyzed the genres associated with each movie to identify popular genres and trends over time.
+ **Director Insights:** Mapped directors to their respective movies and evaluated the impact of directors on movie success.
- **Role and Cast Analysis:** Assessed the roles played by different actors in movies and explored the influence of cast members on movie performance.
* **Ratings and Reviews:** Evaluated the average ratings, total votes, and median ratings of movies to understand audience preferences and critical reception.
  
This analysis provided comprehensive insights into movie performance, helping the industry make data-driven decisions to optimize production, marketing strategies, and enhance viewer satisfaction.
